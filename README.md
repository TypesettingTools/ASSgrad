Ladies and Mentlegen, I introduce you to YIYAGTFA: YIYAGTFA Isn't Yet Another Gradient Tool For Aegisub!

No, wait, I decided to call it ASSgrad.

And that's because it makes gradients. They are a lot of ASS. Its exciting feature is that it can do diagonal gradients. This is cool, but can mean even more ASS. The amount of ASS generated by this script can make renderers perform like ASS, especially if you're trying to make awesome ASS or avoid banding that totally looks like ASS.

Currently, because I am an ASS, it's nearly unusable.
